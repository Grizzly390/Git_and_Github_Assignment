Q4. Briefly explain what GitHub is and how it facilitates collaboration and version control also name some
alternatives to GitHub.

GitHub is a web-based platform for version control and collaboration, primarily used for managing and sharing source code. It allows multiple individuals or teams to work together on software development projects.

Here's how GitHub facilitates collaboration and version control:
1.Version Control: 
    GitHub uses Git, a distributed version control system, to track changes in code over time. This allows developers to manage and keep a history of their codebase, making it easier to track changes, collaborate, and revert to previous versions when necessary.

2.Collaboration: 
    GitHub provides tools for collaboration, such as pull requests, issues, and project boards. Developers can work on different branches, create pull requests to propose changes, and discuss them with team members. This makes it easier to review and merge code, ensuring code quality and collaboration.

3.Code Hosting:
    GitHub hosts code repositories in the cloud, making it accessible to team members from anywhere with an internet connection. This eliminates the need for developers to share code files manually.

4.Access Control: 
    GitHub offers granular access control, allowing project owners to manage permissions for team members. This ensures that only authorized users can make changes to the codebase.

Some alternatives to GitHub include:

1.GitLab: 
    GitLab is a similar platform to GitHub, offering version control and collaboration features. It can be self-hosted or used through GitLab's cloud service.

2.Bitbucket: 
    Bitbucket is another web-based platform that supports Git and Mercurial repositories. It's often used by teams for version control and collaboration.

3.Azure DevOps: 
    Microsoft's Azure DevOps provides a set of tools for software development, including version control, continuous integration, and project management features.

4.SourceForge: 
    SourceForge is an older platform that offers version control and collaboration tools, particularly popular for open-source projects.

5.GitKraken: 
    GitKraken is a Git client with built-in collaboration features, including a graphical interface for managing repositories and pull requests.
